`Cube` is an RPC framework for CUDA runtime. I decided to initiate this project for two main reasons. Firstly, I aim at an open implementation for such a framework. Secondly, I believe it can be better than alternatives or deserves a try. For now, I work on the project on my spare time and would welcome any help. The target operating system and runtime are `Windows` and `CUDA 10` for now.

## How CUDA API works?

This section includes my findings on how the CUDA runtime is linked with `PE` files and how the APIs are called.
